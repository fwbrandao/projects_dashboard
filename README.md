Projects Dashboard. 

This is a work in progress dashboard to host projects and technologies I've learned.

This is a scalable app with microfrontend architecture and module federation. The app has webpack configuration with a full CI/CD pipeline. It's also deployed on Amazon Web Services using CloudFront.

Microfrontends are used to divide a large app into a series of smaller apps. This provides a set of unique benefits to any frontend:

1 - Author smaller, easier to understand codebases

2 - Use a different set of libraries for each sub-app - bring the best tool for the job!

3 - Deploy each portion separately - limit the chance of interrupting your users

4 - Allow each of your engineering teams to work independently

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
